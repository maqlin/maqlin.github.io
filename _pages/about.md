Hi, I'm Qinglin Ma, a fifth year graduate student from [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua university. 
My research interest includes large-scale structure, halo-galaxy connection and galaxy formation. My core expertise lies in computational astrophysics, specifically in analyzing N-body simulations and hydrodynamical simulations (i.e. IllustrisTNG and FIRE simulations). Complementing this, I possess skills in creating realistic mock observations (e.g., mock catalogs) from simulation outputs. 

I am currently advised by [Prof. Li Cheng](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cli/) from Tsinghua university and [Prof. Mo Houjun](https://people.umass.edu/hjmo/) from University of Massachusetts. 

In my spare time, I like playing table tennis and badminton:)
