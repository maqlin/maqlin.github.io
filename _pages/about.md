Hi, I'm Qinglin Ma, a fifth year graduate student from [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua university. 
My research interest includes large-scale structure, halo-galaxy connection and galaxy formation. I am currently advised by [Prof. Li Cheng](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cli/) from Tsinghua university and [Prof. Mo Houjun](https://people.umass.edu/hjmo/) from University of Massachusetts. 

My core expertise lies in computational astrophysics, specifically in analyzing N-body simulations and hydrodynamical simulations (e.g. IllustrisTNG and FIRE simulations). On one hand, I'am interested in how the large-scale structure affects the halo formation, especially for the halo shape, spin and alignment. On the other hand, I am worked on how the halo secondary properties (e.g. formation time, spin) leads to different galaxy properties. 
Complementing this, I possess skills in creating realistic mock observations from simulation outputs. Specifically, I co-developed a novel mock catalog that accounts for the 3D/2D principal axis orientations of simulated galaxies, crucial for alignment studies.

In my spare time, I like playing table tennis and badminton:)
